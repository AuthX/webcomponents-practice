                    <div class="card-header" data-header>
                        <h2>

                            </button>
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card-body" data-body hidden>
                        This is the accordion example. You can take a look at the code at /src/components/accordion/index.js<br />
                        You can get familiar with how the build works as well.
                    </div>
                    <div class="card-header" data-header>
                        <h2>
                            <button class="btn btn-link" type="button">
                                How the build works
                            </button>
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card-body" data-body hidden>
                        The build picks up everything linked from /src/index.js and builds it into a main.js. CSS files that are imported get included and built into a main.css file.<br />
                        That's pretty much all there is to it. This example was built with Bootstrap only for quick styling because the exact look doesn't matter.
                    </div>
                    <div class="card-header" data-header>
                        <h2>
                            <button class="btn btn-link" type="button">
                                Next steps
                            </button>
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card-body" data-body hidden>
                        You could look at the Accordion code and probably figure out a more efficient or different way of doing things.<br />
                        During a meeting, we can tack more things onto this example and build more things for fun.
