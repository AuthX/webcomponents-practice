                        This version of the accordion uses the details element for native browser "accordion" behavior. It retains some functionality when JavaScript is off, and discloses all details on unsupported browsers. ðŸ˜„

                        This is the accordion example. You can take a look at the code at /src/components/accordion/index.js<br />
                        You can get familiar with how the build works as well.

                    <p class="card-body">
                        The build picks up everything linked from /src/index.js and builds it into a main.js. CSS files that are imported get included and built into a main.css file.<br />
                        That's pretty much all there is to it. This example was built with Bootstrap only for quick styling because the exact look doesn't matter.

                        You could look at the Accordion code and probably figure out a more efficient or different way of doing things.<br />
                        During a meeting, we can tack more things onto this example and build more things for fun.
